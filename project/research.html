                <h2> Recent developments and advancements in knee implants materials, manufacturing</h2>
                <p>In today’s scenario knee implant is designed to replace the knee joint damaged bone. The evolution of knee arthroplasty with improved designs and longer implant life span has taken place in the last 30 years. Rapid improvements to gain the best possible results are been done. The objective of review is to examine the materials and manufacturing progress to find the best possible outcomes for future development. In knee implants, the biocompatible materials like zirconium, Titanium alloys, UHMWP (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene), smart materials have developed the performance of the implants. Coated implants are used for metal sensitive patients. The knee replacement techniques give a relief to the patient but there are many forces acting on the tibia and femoral components from the daily activities of a person. These constant forces and infections can lead to slow developed of wear in the joint. Some of the literatures discuss on knee joint simulation under different constraints and conditions which can be checked as its real time behavior. Many studies have done simulation analysis to know the behavior under the different static and dynamic loading conditions. There have been a few studies in field of knee arthroplasty, but different studies suggest different results. Present article viewed the overall growth in aspects of materials and coatings with better mechanical and biocompatible properties, manufacturing processes that will lead to simpler techniques, implant design, analysis of loads for reduction of wear, finite element analysis to validate the prior information, assessment of failure, sensitivity detections.</p>

                <h2>Smart Cane: Assistive Cane for Visually-impaired People</h2>
                <p>This paper reports on a study that helps visually-impaired people to walk more confidently. The study hypothesizes that a smart cane that alerts visually-impaired people over obstacles in front could help them in walking with less accident. The aim of the paper is to address the development work of a cane that could communicate with the users through voice alert and vibration, which is named Smart Cane. T he development work involves coding and physical installation. A series of tests have been carried out on the smart cane and the results are discussed. This study found that the Smart Cane functions well as intended, in alerting users about the obstacles in front</p>
